# Brookshear Machine Algorithm Code (Unfinished)

(made during the 2024 Royal Holloway Hackathon)

## What is the Brookshear Machine Algorithm?

The Brookshear Machine Algorithm is a computational process that operates on a machine's memory and executes instructions stored in that memory. In the provided code excerpt, the algorithm is being implemented within an HTML file. The algorithm involves a series of steps, including fetching instructions from memory, decoding them to determine their meaning, and executing the corresponding operations. The algorithm also involves the use of registers, which are special storage locations within the machine that hold data temporarily. The algorithm's progress is displayed on the webpage through various HTML elements, such as the PC (Program Counter), CIR (Current Instruction Register), and memory contents. By clicking the "fetch," "decode," and "execute" buttons, the algorithm progresses through its steps, updating the HTML elements accordingly.

## Progress we made in the code

We have built it up to the point of running algorithms, but we were not quite able to get the assembler to work.

Our initial project for the Royal Hackathon was a Mastodon node-based program, which would attempt to graph every one of your connections, the connections between them, and then each of their connections. We attempted this in Python using a number of unusually niche libraries, including plot.ly and others, but came into multiple issues, not only with the lack of documentation for many of the libraries we were attempting to use, but also wth respect to the time it took to do data requests. Even with only scanning a single layer, we were often waiting minutes for single requests, making the hackathon project de factor unfeasible.

## Overall thoughts

In spite of switching our project at a later point into the day (with roughly 12 hours left, including time for sleep), we managed to build a reasonably advanced machine algorithm, even if it's unusable. These types of programs can be used for creating simple programming languages built on top of others, and this is something that I wish to gain more knowledge as I continue with my University of Kent degree, even as it specialises in Artificial Intelligence. I think it would be very useful to understand the underlying features that make up programming languages, as well as programs that attempt to do emulation.

I had a great team behind me, and it was excellent to be surrounded by people who were just as passionate, if not even more, in this subject, and who had much more advanced knowledge of programming languages and algorithms compared to me. They all did very well, in spite of the difficulties.

This was my first hackathon, and I really enjoyed it. I look forward to attending more in the future.
